Our R & D project is to build a Security System with Video and Audio Support.
We used the system of face detection to alert the system of any intrusion from human being in human abandoned area.
To implement the system, we took the approach of face detection.
Face detection is an important part of face recognition as the first step of automatic face recognition.
However, face detection is not straightforward because it has lots of variations of image appearance, such as pose variation (front, non-front), image orientation, illuminating condition and facial expression.
Automatic face detection is a complex problem in image processing. Many methods exist to solve this problem such as template matching, Fisher Linear Discriminant.
We used openCV library for face detection and java jssc library for connecting with the hardware. The firmware was written in C programming language and compiled using XC8 compiler for Microchip PIC16 microcontroller.
